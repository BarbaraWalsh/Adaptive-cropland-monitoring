Terrestrial landscapes and their constituent ecosystems, including the ones now dominated by humans, are ultimately controlled both by external and internal factors. The external factors, or the so called state factors (of landscape, ecosystem and soil formation), control overall landscape dynamics and the way things work within those geographical and physical boundaries (cite).  

Climate determines the biomes in which landscapes and ecosystems are embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures broadly influence the rate of photosynthesis, primary and secondary production which determine the overall fluxes of water, nutrients and energy that are available to plants and animals in a landscape. Parent materials determine the nature and composition of cropland soils, and strongly influence the supplies of mineral nutrients and soil physical properties (e.g., texture and metal oxide compositions). Topography influences landscape primary and secondary production processes by affecting microclimate, the rate soil development, weathering rates, erosion/ablation and the overall movement of water and soluble nutrients through the system. The time state factor (perhaps more appropriately entropy) influences all of the others.

Other external factors that play an important roles in lanscape functioning include the potential biota. The set of organisms that can potentially be present in an area can also significantly affect landscape dynamics. For example, landscapes in similar environments, located in different biomes of the world, can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different plant and animal species present. The introduction of long-term cultivation of various crop species and livestock can cause substantial shifts in the landscape and ecosystem functions that we all rely on. For example, Argentinian agricultural landscapes are quite different from the corresponding South African ones, which are located in the same general biomes (and at similar latitude).

Unlike the external factors, the internal factors not only control landscape and ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them *inter alia*. Consequently, internal facors are often subject to feedback loops that either accellerate or balance otherwise *"natural"* processes. Whereas, primary and secondary production resource inputs are largely controlled by the external processes like climate, parent material and soil condition, the availability and dynamics of these resources within landcapes is controlled by internal factors like plant and animal inputs viz e.g., decomposition, root competition, fire, shading and predation. Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species currently present are also internal factors. 

As the human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on their constituent landscapes and ecosystems and their effects of the human ecological footprint see @: [**Ecological Footprint**](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/). Food production systems appear to be increasingly vulnerable, and the socio-ecological, health and environmental impacts of our anthropogenic legacies are becoming increasingly apparent (cite). Resource aquisition conflicts increasingly appear to drive our global economies, politics, trade agreements and survival strategies at an accelerated pace (cite).

Current problems in all landscapes and ecosystems include: stagnant or decreasing primary productivity relative to increasing food production demands, soil and water pollution, climate change, emergent diseases and biodiversity losses, which are significant side effects (on human and others) of generally *"well intentioned"* management interventions. However these interventions have had long-term, unforeseen side-effects that in many instances negate and complicate those *well intentioned* management efforts in a balancing loop (negative) feedback cycle that is offset by a reinforcing loop (positive) feedback cycle that requires increasingly more interventions over time, which we reference as *"fixes that fail system"* (or FTF).

## General dynamics of systems with "fixes that fail"

The current developed country agricultural paradigm is to manage agricultultural productivity and production is based on perceived productivity/production gaps. The main idea is that if and when the perceived gaps are large relative to what is economically desired, fixes (like input subsidies, genomic technologies and agronomic management reccomendations etc) will be implemented to remedy/close those perceived gaps. The basic dynamics of this type of thinking are shown in (Fig. \@ref(current_balancing_approach)).

```{r current_balancing_approach, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Current paradigm for yield/production fix dynamics.", out.width = '50%', }

```

While this sort of strategy is not a completely terrible idea and has served agricultural production well under many circumstances, but there are always the (potentially) long-term of side-effects that should be considered and weighed appropriately. In medical practice considering side-effects is now standard practice, but in natural resource management it is still quite rare for land managers to consider long-term side effects i.e., beyond their own lifetimes. The FTF dynamics, which can ensue are shown in (Fig. \@ref(FTF))

```{r FTF, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Managing production gaps with potentially counter productive side-effects.", out.width = '50%'}

```

**Fixes That Fail (FTF) systems** are a classic construct that is used in system dynamics to describe and analyze a situation where a “fix” that may be effective in the short-term creates detrimental side effects for the longer-term dynamics of the system. These can result in the need for even more management fixes. FTF systems have common characteristics and dynamics that have been demonstrated over a wide range of human endeavors and geographies. FTF systems have the following general charateristics:

* They initially operate in a standard “balancing loop” fashion". However, the management actions that change the current state toward the desired state also influence some side effects e.g., soil erosion, acidification, saliniztion, nutrient and/or organic matter depletion. The side effects subsequently impede reaching the desired ecological state or production goal.
* FTF dynamics are difficult to manage because of the potential time delays associated with the side-effects and fluctuations in the production environment. It is therefore difficult to see and measure what is happening.
* FTF structures are often part of more elaborate structures in which managers and policy makers are dealing with symptoms rather than with the underlying problem(s). They also often become dependent on fixes, applying them over and over, and expecting different results.
* FTF dynamical structures also underpin related system archetypes wherein cooperative influences in institutions are unintentionally responsible for creating problems for the involved parties. For additional insights into this phenomenon see e.g.: [**Accidental Adversaries**](https://thesystemsthinker.com/accidental-adversaries-when-friends-become-foes/).

While the last point may appear to be a complete aside, it is also real human force in hindering development progress in Africa and its global markets for food. Much like during the "Scramble for Africa" (cite), which occurred between 1881 and 1914, nations are now still in a more less "friendly" competition to improve living conditions for African smallholder farmers. The problem is that those nations can, and probably have, become accidental adversaries, just because of the underlying dynamical systems that are driven by misunderstandings and often by only partial knowledge of what the facts or development needs really are. In turn these conflicts currently shape African economies.

## Adaptive management of landscapes

Adaptive management (AM) is “Natural Resource Management conducted in a manner that purposely and explicitly aims at increasing knowledge and reducing uncertainty” (Holling 1978, Walters 1986)". AM is particularly useful, and currently probably the only effective means, for managing FTF-type systems because of the uncertainties and complex long-term dynamics inherent in these. Adaptive management is data intensive because there is *"reinforcement learning (RL)"* involved. RL is how we and other species learn to walk. The approach seems to work, also in contexts other than just walking and particularly for machine-learning. Note that an average farmer in Africa will have ~25-30 years to learn how to get both the farming business bits and their potential side effects right. Our effort here is dedicated to support and accelerate the related reinforcement learning processes without harming future generations ... do no harm!

Adaptive assessment (AA) “tries to define what is known and what is not known about various adaptive management issues and how these evolve over time and space” (Holling 1978). It is corollary and antecedent to AM, and attempts to make explicit the assumptions underlying management actions. AM actions can then be structured and validated to test those assumptions, while solving specific AM issues. By doing so, AA attempts to continually fill the gap between knowledge and action. It does not help people to stop drinking alcohol as the "AA" acronym might imply. However, in the cropland management context, rather than focusing on the rather narrow and short-term goal of optimising for an immediate production gap, AA assesses social-ecological state variables more broadly and attempts to anticipate the evolution of significant side effects as well as changes in production environments and their socio-ecological contexts.

## What this book is about

This book is about the processes for producing and using (useful) data and information for adaptive management via an aadaptive assessment workflow. We now have many new tools, including high-resolution satellite observations, telcom-based data collection tools and low cost laboratory and data analysis techniques that we did not have available even 10 years ago. The book provides introductions to new assessment techniques that use those technolgies. In most of the ensuing chapters real, generally live datasets from Africa are used to demonstrate how these may be used in real landscapes. We also adhere to completely [**FAIR*](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data and code principles, which are rapidly becoming an international standard that enthusiaclly support. All of the associated workflows are done in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), and we gratefully acknowledge the R community for doing all of that hard work that makes our lives and teaching efforts so much more possible.
